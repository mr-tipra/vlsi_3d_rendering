# VLSI Project: 3D Rendering

The host files (test bench) are in the host folder. Include the 3 .cpp files as test bench files, while also defining the MACRO HW using **-DHW** for both C-sim and Co-sim.

The correponding area/latency/base solutions are in their respective folders. Include the .cpp file as main file, selecting *rendering* as top function.
